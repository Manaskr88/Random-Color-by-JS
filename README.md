 A random color generator! ðŸŽ¨

This simple web app generates a random color in hex format, and displays it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The color is generated using the Math.random() function in JavaScript, and the resulting hex value is displayed in an HTML element with a corresponding background color.

I had a lot of fun building this project, and it was a great way to practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned some new techniques for generating random values and manipulating DOM elements.
